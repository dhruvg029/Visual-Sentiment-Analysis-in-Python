Folder consists of 2 files, gen_img.py and save_img.py

gen_img.py is used for generating links of images and save_img.py is used for saving them in image format.

to download data set, save two files in same Folder

in terminal write, "python3 gen_img.py class_name *size_of_data_set*"

this will create a csv file named class_name_urls.csv in same directory

then in terminal write, "python3 save_img.py class_name_urls.csv"

this will create a folder named class_name in same directory containing images

(note that number of images are less than the size_of_data_set you entered due to some corrupted images)
